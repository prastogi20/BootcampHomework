# Increase GDP of internet

Two young brother form Ireland have democratised online payments – and reshaped the digital economy in the process.

## Overview and Origin

In year 2005 on a cold winter night in Varanasi (India), near the banks of holy river Ganga Ali proud owner of a small handloom company was holding beautiflly designed fabric made by his workers that involved intrique work of 90 hrs. The more he look at the  fabric he feels that how could he pay well to his workers. He could barely manage to pay the minimum wages selling in local market. It was time to expand and sell in bigger markets, but he could do so sitting in Varanasi. As he had low income and lack of assets the traditional bank would not give him loan to setup something in another town . It is a challenge for him to introduce himself to big Retailers or wholesaler in his domain.

"According to the World Bank’s Small and Medium Enterprise Department, there are between 365 and 445 million micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in emerging markets, contributing up to 60% of employment and up to 40% of national GDP. The main problem these companies face is access to finance. So how can entrepreneurs from emerging nations join the global market and help lift the wealth of their nations? One of the solutions comes from a small village in Ireland called Dromineer, of population 102 and the birthplace of the world’s youngest self-made billionaires, Patrick and John Collision."

Dromineer is a beautiful Irish village - It’s also where Patrick and John Collison, learned to code – and where they began to think about online payments. It’s where they began laying the foundations for **Stripe**. Patrick and John found school boring. They always found the technical chats aournd the family table interesting which clearly outstripped anything they learned in school. Their father,trained as an electronic engineer and mother, as a microbiologist, laid the foundation that made them fascinated by maths and physics. 

In their teens they launched their first startups **Auctomatic** – a software-as-a-service platform for eBay power sellers to track inventory and traffic – and an iPhone app providing an offline copy of Wikipedia, pitched by the brothers as **Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy** on the iPhone.

In 1998 Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Max Levchin launched **PayPal** which was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. PayPal supposed to have solved online payment,but layers of intermediation still existed. Also, once the turnover of a company reaches a certain level PayPal would automatically put the business on 21-60 days of rolling reserve, which means a company would not have access to around 30% of its revenue for upto 2 months.

In 2008, Patrick and John sold their first startup Auctomatic to Canada’s Live Current Media for $5 million, post which they went back to university, MIT and Harvard respectively. Where they came up with 7 lines of code that anyone could insert in their website or app in a day to connect to a payment compay. A complex process that would take weeks was now reduced to simple copy and paste.

In 2010, the brothers dropped out of college and launched a service /dev/payments with a promise that the 7 lines of code is all that developers for online payment integration.

In 2011, they pitched Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, the founders of PayPal - the idea of removing layers of intermeditaion and provide fast and secure online Payment solution that could be integrated with any website or app with just 7 lines of code. This resulted into seed investment of $2 million. Finally in **September 2011 they launched Stripe**

"Just five months after launching, Stripe already raised another round of funding – an $18 million Series A that valued the company at $100 million. The round was led by Sequoia Capital with participation from Affirm and PayPal co-founder Max Levchin. Later that year, Stripe expanded to Canada, its first foreign country."

By 2013 Stripe was successful enough for expansion. In March 2013 bought Kickoff which is a chat and task management platform. Futhermore they exppanded Stripe expanded it's product lineup. Stripe became so big by 2016 that other Fintech companies like PayPal and Square launched payment processing products. A year later in 2017 Stripe bought the business community named Indie Hackers. The same year Stripe sign up some Huge clients including Amazon, Facebook, or Uber

"By 2018, Stripe started to invest heavily in other startups, either in the FinTech space or other industries. The thinking behind those investments was (and still is) that Stripe’s clients generate an abundance of data. This allows Stripe to assess how those companies are performing financially, especially in relation to competition that might be part of the platform."

In 2020 when the world was finding ways to keep the businesses up and running in a pandemic, Stripe sales skyroceted as more and more businesses went online. The ease of intergation and fast movement of money across globe made Stripe popular between small, mid and Big businesses. As a result Stripe was able to rasie its valuation to $95 billion from $20 billion in 2019. Today Stripe work together with more than million businesses worldwide.

Once that was launched as a online payment processing company has now a range of products that supports small and big businesses across domains. As they say "Stripe builds financial tools and economic infrastructure for the internet. We’re helping small startups and the world’s biggest companies build products, create business models and scale their efforts globally."

## Results and Analysis

Stripe is renowned for its speedy and secure payment processing. In addition, because of its ease of integration and convenience of use, many business owners and developers find it easy to work with Stripe's platform.

### Stripe Pros

- *Pricing*: On the whole, Stripe has a simple, transparent pricing structure and only charges transaction fees. Stripe does not charge other typical fees that some merchant service providers charge, which makes its pricing model simple. Stripe users only have to worry about a single, flat-rate, per-transaction charge if they are accepting online payments. Plus, this rate is competitive with other processors on the market and Stripe includes all of their pricing information on their website.

- *Functionality*: As a payments solution, Stripe is extremely functional, allowing users to accept all types of payments in the way that works best for the business. With an emphasis on online payments, Stripe gives it's users the ability to accept payments through an embeddable checkout, custom payment form, and even through invoices. Plus, despite their online payment focus, businesses can also accept in-person payments with Stripe. Another highlight is that business owners can sign up for an account quickly and easily online and get started taking payments instantly. Stripe also includes a standard level of security, can accommodate international commerce, and integrates with hundreds of other platforms.

- *Customization*: Stripe is often referred to as a “developer’s payments solution,” due to their custom UI toolkit and available APIs. With these tools, users can completely customize payments solution. For non developers Stripe offers an impressive level of built in tools that helps customization for all business owners.

### Stripe Cons

- *Account stability*: Stripe is a payment service provider (PSP), meaning they aggregate all of their customers’ payments into a single merchant account and distribute the funds from there. Among other benefits, one of the most notable advantages of a PSP is that you can sign up for an account quickly and easily, without the underwriting process required to get a dedicated merchant account for your business. This being said, however, this type of system also means that your Stripe account is subject to greater stability issues—if Stripe deems your business too risky, they can cancel or freeze your account with little notice.

- *Cost*: Although Stripe’s pricing can be an advantage, it can also be a drawback. Even though the pricing is easy to understand and there are very few Stripe fees, Stripe may not always be the most affordable solution. Some users also report that Stripe can be expensive, particularly if you decide to utilize their paid add-on tools.

- *Developer-focused*: The developer-focus of Stripe is extremely useful if you’re a developer or have access to developer resources, but if you don’t, you may not be able to take advantage of everything Stripe has to offer. Although any business can use Stripe, there may be options that are more user-friendly and can work better for those without developer experience or access to those resources.

- *In-person payments*: Although Stripe does offer a solution for accepting in-person payments, the platform really isn’t designed for that purpose. Business owners looking to first and foremost accept in-person payments will benefit more from a point of sale-focused solution with capabilities more suited to meet their needs.

### Stripe Competitors
 Considering the breadth of the merchant services industry, there are a variety of alternatives out there—from full-service merchant account providers to simple payment gateway providers. 

- **Square** Like Stripe, Square has quickly become one of the most recognizable names in the payment processing space. First and foremost, Square is a POS provider with free POS software and a variety of hardware options. However, Square has a vast product suite that extends beyond POS and into ecommerce, online payments, invoicing, and more. Here are some of the biggest benefits of Square when compared to Stripe:
    - *Point of sale*: If accepting in-person payments is a priority for a business than, Square will be a better solution than Stripe. Square offers free POS software and multiple hardware options—plus, their in-person transaction fees are lower at 2.6% + $0.10 per transaction. Although Stripe can integrate with POS solutions, Square can provide actual payment processing, as well as POS system options that can accommodate a variety of small businesses. Overall, between their robust free POS software, additional product options, and ease of use, Square is a top POS provider and can offer much more for in-person payments than Stripe.

    - *Online store*: Square offers a full online store service, with the first subscription plan available at $0 per month—you only pay transaction fees.

    Overall, Square a top alternative to Stripe if one is looking for a solution that extends beyond online payments. Although Square’s online payments platform may not be as sophisticated as Stripe’s, Square offers a user-friendly solution for building an ecommerce store, as well as accepting both online and in-person payments. With their POS system, Square will certainly be a better option for brick-and-mortar retailers and can be particularly useful for those retailers looking to branch into online sales.

- **Paypal** is very likely one of the first brand names that comes to mind when we talk about online payments. PayPal has years of experience with online payments and continues to be a go-to solution for individuals and businesses alike. All in all, PayPal allows business owners to accept online payments in different ways—they offer a simple payment gateway service that gives business owners the ability to create a hosted checkout page, they provide a full-service solution to customize payments form, and they even offer PayPal Here for accepting in-person payments. When comparing Stripe vs. PayPal, PayPal stands out in the following ways:

    - *User-friendly*: Similar to Square, one of the advantages that PayPal has over Stripe is usability. Although PayPal may not be as advanced as Stripe, it’s still highly functional and likely easier for the average business owner to use. Whereas one may need assistance setting up Stripe or customizing it for business’s needs, PayPal will be much more approachable and simpler to implement.

    - *Merchant account compatible*: If an owner already have a dedicated merchant account for business and owner would want to use this account for online payments, PayPal will definitely be a better choice compared to Stripe. With PayPal, business owners have the option to use an existing merchant account in conjunction with their services, whereas Stripe account requires that business owners use Stripe as payment aggregator.
    - *PayPal Here*: Although PayPal’s in-person payment solution, PayPal Here, isn’t as robust of a POS system like Square, it will be much easier to use than Stripe’s in-person payment solution—and with a flat-rate transaction fee of 2.7% per U.S. card payment, PayPal Here is slightly cheaper than Stripe’s in-person processing. Therefore, if you’re not an exclusively web-based business, a combination of PayPal’s online payments platform and their in-person services may be better-suited for business.

    Taking these points into consideration, PayPal is a very close competitor to Stripe. For their online payment processing, they charge similar fees and both providers give you a variety of different ways to customize their online payments solution for your business. This being said, however, where Stripe is more advanced and complex, PayPal is generally more simple and straightforward. Plus, for accepting in-person payments, PayPal Here is going to be much easier to use than Stripe.
